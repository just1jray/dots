description: Review code for bugs, performance, maintainability, and readability
---

Review this code with priorities: (1) bugs/security, (2) performance, (3) maintainability, (4) readability.

**Phase 1 - Assessment:** What does it do? What's working? What concerns you?

**Phase 2 - Findings:** List issues with severity (Critical/Important/Minor/Nitpick), location, and why it matters.

**Phase 3 - Plan:** Group fixes logically, suggest order, note dependencies. **Stop and wait for my approval.**

**Phase 4 - Implement:** After approval, fix one group at a time. Explain changes. Run tests.

Explain reasoning—I want to learn, not just get fixes.
