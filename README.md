## 📦 Installation

### ✅ Check Prerequisites

Run this command to check which tools are installed:

```bash
for cmd in git zsh curl wget starship nvim tmux fzf zoxide; do command -v $cmd >/dev/null && echo "✓ $cmd" || echo "✗ $cmd"; done
```

### 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/just1jray/dots.git ~/Developer/src/dots
cd ~/Developer/src/dots
./setup.sh
```

### 🎛️ Setup Script Options

```bash
./setup.sh [options]

Options:
  -h, --help          Show help message
  -f, --force         Force overwrite without backup
  -n, --dry-run       Preview changes without applying
  -s, --skip-plugins  Skip plugin installation
  -c, --check-nvchad  Check NVChad installation status
```

### 📋 What the Setup Script Does

1. 📁 **Creates necessary directories** for configs and plugins
2. 💾 **Backs up existing configs** (unless `--force` is used)
3. 🔗 **Symlinks config files** to proper locations:
   - `~/.zshrc` → `zsh/zshrc`
   - `~/.config/starship.toml` → `starship/starship.toml`
   - `~/.config/nvim/` → `nvim/`
   - `~/.tmux.conf` → `tmux/tmux.conf`
   - `~/.vimrc` → `vim/vimrc`
   - `~/.claude/` → `claude/` (if Claude Code is installed)
4. 🔌 **Installs Zinit** plugin manager for zsh
5. 📝 **Installs NVChad** for Neovim (if nvim is installed)
6. 🪟 **Installs Tmux Plugin Manager** (TPM) and plugins
7. 💻 **Loads platform-specific profiles** based on OS

## 🛠️ Customization

### 💻 Platform-Specific Settings

The zshrc automatically loads platform-specific profiles:
- 🍎 **macOS**: Sources `~/.config/zsh/profile-macos`
- 🐧 **Linux**: Sources `~/.config/zsh/profile-linux`

Add platform-specific environment variables, paths, or aliases to these files.

### 🌟 Starship Prompt

Edit `starship/starship.toml` to customize your prompt appearance and modules.

### 👻 Ghostty

The `ghostty/config` includes several customizations:

- ⚡ **Quick terminal** - Toggle terminal with `ctrl+`` ` (requires Ghostty 1.1+)
- ✂️ **Split keybindings**:
  - `cmd+shift+enter` - Horizontal split
  - `cmd+opt+enter` - Vertical split
  - `cmd+d` - Close split

### 📝 NVChad

Customize Neovim by editing files in `nvim/lua/`:
- `chadrc.lua` - NVChad theme and UI settings
- `options.lua` - Vim options
- `mappings.lua` - Custom keybindings
- `plugins/` - Plugin configurations

### 🤖 Claude Code

The dotfiles include Claude Code configuration in the `claude/` directory:

- 🪝 **hooks/** - Custom hook scripts
  - `stop-hook-git-check.sh` - Git safety hook that prevents closing sessions with uncommitted/unpushed changes
- 💬 **commands/** - Custom slash commands
  - `/review-edu` - Educational code review command
- 🧠 **skills/** - Custom Claude Code skills
  - `session-start-hook/` - Skill for creating startup hooks in repositories
  - `code-review-edu/` - Thorough code review skill (triggers on "review this code", "find bugs", etc.)

The setup script automatically symlinks `~/.claude/` to the `claude/` directory in this repository.

**Note:** Claude Code will create additional directories in `~/.claude/` for session data, plans, and other runtime files. These are managed by Claude and not tracked in this dotfiles repository.
