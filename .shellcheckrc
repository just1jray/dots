# ShellCheck configuration
# https://www.shellcheck.net/wiki/Directive

# Disable specific checks

# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source
# Reason: We source files with variables in paths
disable=SC1090

# SC1091: Not following sourced files
# Reason: Some sourced files may not exist yet or are external
disable=SC1091

# SC2148: Tips depend on target shell
# Reason: We explicitly set shell in shebang
disable=SC2148

# SC2312: Consider invoking this command separately to avoid masking its return value
# Reason: We intentionally use command substitution in some contexts
disable=SC2312

# Enable optional checks for better code quality

# Suggest adding quotes around variables
enable=quote-safe-variables

# Warn about unquoted variables in [[ ]]
enable=avoid-nullary-conditions

# Require explicit [[ -v var ]] instead of [[ -n $var ]]
enable=check-unassigned-uppercase

# Default shell dialect
# This can be overridden with shebang or shellcheck directive
shell=bash

# External sources to follow
# Add paths to external scripts that shellcheck should analyze
# external-sources=true
